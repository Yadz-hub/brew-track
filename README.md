BrewTrack is an application that aims to provide customers with a single source of information about breweries, specifically brew pubs, that they can use to plan and coordinate events for their own customers or businesses. 

The application will leverage a digital service provider's catalogue of breweries to provide customers with a list of brew pubs that can cater to events. Additionally, the application will provide weather information to assist customers in making informed decisions. 

To drive growth to the current business portfolios, customers will be encouraged to sign up using the application for future marketing.
